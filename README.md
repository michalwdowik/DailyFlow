# ToDoApp

The ToDoApp is a web application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Eslint, and Prettier. The app allows users to create and manage their to-do lists by adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Users can also create custom categories by inputting a name and selecting an icon and the color of the category. Every task has a "details" button that shows a modal with details of a task ie. "days to deadline of a task". The application is responsive to user errors and successes and displays relevant alerts. The project is designed to provide a simple and intuitive user experience, with a clean and modern interface that is easy to use and navigate.
